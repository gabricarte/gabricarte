## âœ¨ Welcome to my profile! âœ¨

### I'm a technology lover ðŸ–¤
#### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a beginner developer. I'm passionate about creating beautiful and functional user interfaces and am excited to grow my skills in this field.

I'm currently working on some personal projects to practice my skills and would love to collaborate with others on open-source projects or learn from more experienced developers. I'm also interested in learning about other front-end technologies and tools, so feel free to share any recommendations or resources with me!

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me exploring new readings and playing chess. Let's connect and grow together! ðŸ˜Š
